          We receive price and stock updates on a daily base from our retail
          partners. After placing your order, you will be asked what our
          Personal Shopper should do in case one of more of your items are out
          of stock. You can select for the whole order or for each unique
          product the following actions: choose “let shopper pick” if you want
          our shoppers to pick the most suitable replacement for you or “call
          me” if you prefer to receive a phone call. Alternatively, you can also
          select “do not replace”.

          price. If you notice an item that you think is priced incorrectly,
          please reach out to us! We reserve the right to cancel items that are

          We allow you to buy non-Halal items using Freshchery, and are very
          careful to ensure that at no point during checkout, delivery, or any
          other time, non-Halal and Halal items get in contact with each other.
          To ensure that, we use different bags and clearly separated parts of
          the box for the transport of non-Halal items.

          If something seems to be wrong with your order, such as a missing item
          or an incorrect item, you can reject the items when our rider arrives
          at your doorstep. We will charge you only for the delivered items.
          Once an item is accepted by you, it cannot be returned. We do not
          currently support a return process for any items you may have
          accidentally purchased via Freshchery. You are more than welcome to
          coordinate returns directly with your store. Keep in mind that we do
          keep the in-store receipts for accounting purposes.

          Like a restaurant or a bar, Freshchery temporarily authorizes your
          card for slightly more than your order total. As soon as your order is
          complete, we charge your card for exactly what was delivered. Your
          bank will update the final charge on your statement in 3 – 7 business
          days after delivery. The temporary authorization can be for up to Rp
          100,000 more than the order total. It helps account for charges like
          items sold by weight. If your final order total exceeds the
          authorization amount, there may be a second charge for the difference.
          You can see all charges reflected at the bottom of your receipt, which
          is available after delivery.

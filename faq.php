        <p class="default-topic">

          We receive price and stock updates on a daily base from our retail
          partners. After placing your order, you will be asked what our
          Personal Shopper should do in case one of more of your items are out
          of stock. You can select for the whole order or for each unique
          product the following actions: choose “let shopper pick” if you want
          our shoppers to pick the most suitable replacement for you or “call
          me” if you prefer to receive a phone call. Alternatively, you can also
          select “do not replace”.

          For some stores, we may add a small service charge on top of the store
          price. If you notice an item that you think is priced incorrectly,
          please reach out to us! We reserve the right to cancel items that are
          priced incorrectly due to error.

        <h4>10. How do you treat items that are non-Halal?</h4>
        <p class="default-topic">

          We allow you to buy non-Halal items using Freshchery, and are very
          careful to ensure that at no point during checkout, delivery, or any
          other time, non-Halal and Halal items get in contact with each other.
          To ensure that, we use different bags and clearly separated parts of
          the box for the transport of non-Halal items.

        <p class="default-topic">

          As long as the stocks are available, our Driver will put your order on
          our very own reuseable shopping bag. If you don’t get the shopping
          bag, it could be happened because the stocks are empty. But we will
          restock our shopping bag in the stores maximum at 1 week, don’t worry.

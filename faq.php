The temporary authorization can be for up to Rp 100,000 more than the order total. It helps account for charges like items sold by weight. If your final order total exceeds the authorization amount, there may be a second charge for the difference. You can see all charges reflected at the bottom of your receipt, which is available after delivery.'
